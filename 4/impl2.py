'''
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

        Palindrome has to be the product of 2 3 digit numbers.
        We use some pruning technique below. 
        As soon as a division might go over 1000 as a result, we prune.
        Because the lower the 3 digit number becomes, the bigger the chance the result is 4 digit.
