# project_euler
My implementations for project euler.

All these implementations are designed to have really low time complexity. The were tested on the challenges on https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges.

## Optimizations

* Challenge 7 can still be further optimized. We are using the sieve of erastothenes, instead sieve of atkin could be used.
